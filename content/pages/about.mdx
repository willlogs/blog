I am glad that you want to know more about me and my blog.

## Me
I am Will. I was born in Iran and moved to Canada at 24. I am 25 now.


I code about anything. I started by doing game dev but I am just excited about anything going on in computers so I learned to code websites and compilers and microcontrollers.
I am confident that I can code anything at this point.

## This Blog
I created this blog as a way to share resources and what I prepare for my coder friends. Sometimes I go down crazy rabbit holes trying to find resources to
learn advanced C programming. Like the techniques you see programmers use in libraries that you download but nobody really talks about in courses.
I thought hey! Maybe someone else would like to know about what I find searching for those stuff and maybe they'll send me a message after reading my list
of resources and we'll make good friends.


So I started this blog to kinda bundle the things I wanna give to people together into posts and keep them organized. I hope you enjoy it!
